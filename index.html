<p class="p1">Trust me babe it won't happen again. I'm not like others.
  <br>
  you won't be regretting choosing me.
  <br>
  if anything i did inappropriate i wouldn't say anything, 
  <br>
  whatever you'll say would be final.
  <br>
  i've seen people get back together and try again, 
  <br>
  and they ended up betten than even.
  <br>
  I promise i would never make your life difficult anymore. I'm sorry

<p class="p1">I know i have hurted you alot, 
  <br>
  and said those things which was not
  <br>
  supposed to be said in any circumstances
  <br>
  i deserve a punishment for this but u don't 
  <br>
  know it's already very difficult for me as we aren't talking, whole day i feel suffocated. 
  <br>
  You are the light of my world, and I can't imagine life without you
  <span style="color: red !important;">❤️</span>
  <br> 
  It feels like every night i'm dying and falling deep down
  <br>
  I value you immensely and I’ve learned a lot from this.
  <br>
  I'm working on myself to ensure this doesn’t
  <br>
  happen again whatever the reason is.
